                <h1>Fixing the Google promo folder</h1>
                <p>It’s a miracle, of course. There are 51,000 unread emails in my promo folder, and 98% of them are unread for a reason. Because I didn’t ask for them and I don’t care what they say.</p>

                <p>But the other 2%? I miss reading those.</p>

                <p>These are the emails from Gretchen, from Tim, from TED. They’re the emails from Sarah Jones, from BoingBoing and from charity:water. These are the blogs and the updates and the announcements that are very definitely NOT promotions. They’re anticipated, personal and relevant messages, delivered with permission.</p>

                <p>Google has business reasons to quarantine notes like this, but it’s not the right thing to do. And we now have a way to fix it.</p>

                <p>A simple button, with just a few clicks, will automatically create a safe place for 98 voices, moving them (past and future) from your promo folder back to your inbox. And it’s easy to undo–if any sender gets annoying, a simple edit of your filters and they’re gone again.</p>

                <p>TED, Oprah, Sarah Jones, Adam Grant, Dan Pink, BoingBoing… all your favorites, unblocked! Fix the promo folder. Authenticate your gmail account and you’re done.</p>

                <p>Everyone on the list will be pointing to the button, and if we coordinate our outreach well, readers who were previously lost forever to the unfairness of Google’s whims will be back where they belong.</p>

                <h2>Here's how it works</h2>
                <p>We’ve built a tiny free app that creates a filter in your gmail account (it only works with gmail, but it works on any browser and on your smartphone as well).</p>

                <p>Once you authenticate the app (<a href='#get_started'>see here for screenshots</a>), it creates a filter that will stop Gmail categorizing messages from the 98 voices as promotions. <b>NOTE! If you have never subscribed to someone, this app won’t change anything--you’re not signing up to hear from people, you’re signing up to have Google stop filtering the emails you’ve already asked for.</b></p>

                <p>It’s worth noting that we are never going to send you an email, and are never going to rent or sell your email address. Using this app won’t create any new emails in your box, and if you ever decide you want something back in the promo folder, all you need to do is turn the filter off.</p>

                <h2>Get started</h2>
                <p>Just click the button. Google will then present you with two or three dialogue boxes you need to check to confirm you want to use it. That’s it.</p>

                <p>It won’t slow down your computer and you’ll never have to do anything again. We’ve posted our code on Github so you can see exactly what it does. Even though Google says that the app can view and modify your mail, it doesn’t. All it does is create a bunch of filters.</p>

                <p><a href='http://www.permission.com' target="_new">Permission marketing</a> is the privilege of delivering anticipated, personal and relevant messages to the people who want to get them. Akimbo’s founder, Seth Godin, wrote a book about this twenty years ago. Along the way, many marketers have abused the idea, and as a result, email marketing has, in the wrong hands, gotten annoying.</p>

                <p>But punishing the people and organizations that you actually want to hear from doesn’t help anyone.</p>

                <p>We don’t think it benefits you to have the messages you want to get stolen from your inbox and moved to a place where you can’t see them. And we know it’s a problem for people and organizations that want to create useful content, because if they’re not reaching their audience, it’s hard for them to keep making the work that matters.</p>
